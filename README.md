DESCRIPTION:
The "Website Traffic Analysis" project aims to analyze website traffic data to gain insights into user behavior, popular pages, and traffic sources. The primary objective is to assist website owners in enhancing the user experience by understanding how visitors interact with the site. This project involves data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and advanced analysis using Python
DEPENDENCIES:
        1.Python: You can download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).
        2.Libraries: Make sure to install the required Python libraries using pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
        3.pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scikit-learn plotly
IBM Cognos : If you intend to create meaningful dashboards and reports with IBM Cognos, make sure to have it installed and set up.
COGNOS INSTRUCTIONS:
If you are using IBM Cognos for creating dashboards and reports, follow these instructions:

       1.Open IBM Cognos and create a new project for website traffic analysis.
       2.Import your data into Cognos or connect it to your data source.
       3.Design your dashboards and reports, including components like line charts for traffic trends, bar charts for popular pages, and pie charts for traffic source distribution.
       4.Implement filters and interactive elements in your reports to allow users to explore data on their own.
       5.Schedule automated report generation and distribution to relevant stakeholders for regular updates.
HOW TO RUN:
       1.To run this project, follow these steps:
       2.Install Python and the required libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.
       3.Load your website traffic data into a Pandas DataFrame using Python. Ensure the data is structured with relevant columns, such as page views, unique visitors, referral sources, and session duration.
       4.Preprocess the data as needed, including data cleaning and transformation.
       5.Visualize the data using Python's data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib or Plotly Express.
       6.If you want to perform advanced analysis, consider using K-means clustering and linear regression as demonstrated in the code.
       7.Optionally, integrate IBM Cognos for more advanced dashboarding and reporting. Follow the "COGNOS Instructions" section for guidance.
       8.Experiment with innovative approaches, such as machine learning, predictive analytics, real-time analytics, user behavior analysis, and data integration, to gain deeper insights into website traffic.
       9.Continuously update and improve your analysis and models by incorporating new data and adapting to changing user behavior.
